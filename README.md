# 👋 Hi, I'm Nidhi Pandya

I'm a civic-tech founder, developer, and former IT project leader driven by a single purpose: building systems that empower people — whether it’s resolving critical tech issues in real time or designing tools that move communities to action.

I'm the founder of **Voice**, a mobile platform that helps people connect with their elected representatives and take collective political action. I built Voice from scratch in Flutter, but I also lead its strategy, outreach, and evolution — because great tech is only one part of building meaningful change.
